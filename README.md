# Simon Game
This app was inspired by the classic electronic game of memory skill from the 70s. The game has four buttons with different colours which are lit up by pressing on it, or being activated. A sound also accompanies the buttons when it is pressed. A round in the game starts by lighting one or more colours at random, after which the player must copy that order by pressing the correct colours. As the game progresses, the number of colours to be pressed increase, as well as the speed at which it is presented.

This project was built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Legacy Front End Web Development course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/]).
